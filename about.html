<p class="aboutText">Hello, I am Conor and despite being nearly 50 years young, I am reliving my youth back in college studying web design. I'm a second year student at the Dublin Institute of Design. A vital part of being a web designer is having a knowledge and understanding of the HTML and CSS code for structuring and styling of a website. But now in Year 2 we are focussed on the considerably more difficult coding that make a website dynamic and interactive - the Javascript. On this website I am sharing some of the work I did for the Computer Programming Principles module.</p>

<p class="aboutText">I have covered a lot of what was taught over the last term including some work on arrays, functions, loops and a few projects utilising several Javascript elements. The portfolio section was built using the Isotope filtering app.</p>

<p class="aboutText">I have found this to be very challenging and hard to follow sometimes but I have compiled a portfolio of some of the things I have been working on in clas and at home over the course of the last term. I am quite happy with some of it but I know I have quite a lot more to learn. Please take a look at some of my work.</p>
